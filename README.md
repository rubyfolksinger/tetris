# Tetris

A minimal Tetris application.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'tetris'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tetris

## Usage

## Code Challenge

Please write Ruby code that plays a game of Tetris (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) with itself. Your simulated player's objective is just to play forever. Don't worry about keeping score or displaying the game. Don't worry about moving the falling pieces downwards while your simulated player thinks, either: your simulated player can make its decision instantaneously, as soon as a new piece appears at the top of the screen. For your first iteration, make all pieces 2x2 squares. That means your simulated player doesn't need to worry about rotating each piece, just moving it left and right and then telling it to drop when it's in the right position.

Write the code test-driven with rspec. (Test::Unit or MiniTest would be fine too. Don't use Cucumber; we love it, but it's too bulky for this exercise.) Refactor it until it's clean enough to eat on. Put the results on github and send me the URL. If you have any questions please ask. Those instructions are ideal, so do whatever you think is appropriate and have time for. The point is for us to see how you test and code and refactor, not to test your knowledge of specific technologies.

You should be able to get at least a few meaningful examples working in an hour or so. It's not critical that you get the game to any particular point, just that you come up with some new code for us to evaluate and work on later. When you think you've spent enough time just stop (again, leaving your work clean enough to eat on) and we'll continue when you visit. If you think you can't get anything done in that amount of time (aside from time taken to learn new tools, if you decided to do that), you might think I'm asking for something that I'm not, so check with me to make sure you've understood the scope. Also, it should be fun; if it isn't you should feel free to adjust the requirements until it is. Keep it simple, though, since if it gets complicated it will be hard to work on when you visit.
